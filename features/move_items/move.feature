  Scenario: Moving reference sections (with feed)
    Given there is a subfamily "Antcatinae" with a reference section "Antcatinae section"
    And there is a genus "Formica"

    When I go to the catalog page for "Antcatinae"
    And I follow "Move items"
    Then I should see "Move items › Select target"

    When I press "Select..."
    Then I should see "Target must be specified"

    When I pick "Formica" from the "to_taxon_id" taxon selector
    And I press "Select..."
    Then I should see "Move items › to Formica"

    When I press "Move selected items"
    Then I should see "At least one item must be selected"

    When I follow "Select all"
    And I press "Move selected items"
    Then I should see "Successfully moved items"
